## Carbon Impact Summary

**Total CO2 Offset**: 387kg  
**Cost**: $87 ($0.22 per kg - excellent rate)  
**Verification**: Gold Standard + Verra certified credits  
**Environmental Equivalent**: 
- 18 tree seedlings grown for 10 years
- 0.08 cars off road for 1 year
- 0.05 average household emissions for 1 year

**Additional Environmental Benefits**:
- 200kg+ local food grown (transport emissions avoided)
- 15% average household energy reduction (ongoing)
- Increased cycling (estimated 200+ car journeys avoided)

## Community Feedback

**Satisfaction Survey (18 responses)**:
- 94% satisfied with transparency of process
- 89% would recommend to other communities  
- 83% plan to participate in next funding cycle
- 72% feel more connected to their neighbors

**Quotes**:
> "Finally, a way to actually get stuff done in the community without years of bureaucracy" - Margaret, 67

> "The carbon offset thing makes me feel like we're thinking globally while acting locally" - Jamie, 34

> "Love that everything is transparent - I can see exactly where money goes" - Priya, 28

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
✅ **Transparent voting** built trust quickly  
✅ **Small initial amounts** reduced risk and encouraged participation  
✅ **Carbon offset integration** appealed to environmentally conscious residents  
✅ **Open-source approach** attracted additional technical volunteers  
✅ **Real local impact** created visible community improvements

### What We'd Change
❌ **Initial setup complexity** - need simpler onboarding  
❌ **Limited project size** - some good ideas needed more funding  
❌ **Communication gaps** - not everyone active on online platforms  
❌ **Seasonal timing** - winter start meant fewer outdoor projects  

### Unexpected Benefits
🎯 **Additional funding attracted**: Platform credibility helped secure extra funding  
🎯 **Cross-community interest**: 3+ areas want to replicate  
🎯 **Skills development**: Community members learned new technical and project management skills  
🎯 **Local business engagement**: 2 local businesses offered sponsorship/support  

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 4 weeks)
- Launch Cycle 4 with $60 + new community contributions
- Onboard 3 additional community members
- Complete replication guide for other areas

### Medium-term (Next 6 months) 
- Support replication in Dennistoun and Partick communities
- Develop partnerships with Glasgow City Council
- Create mobile app for easier community participation

### Long-term (Next year)
- Scale to 10+ Glasgow communities
- Develop inter-community collaboration projects
- Create sustainable funding model independent of external grants

## Replication Guide

**For Other Communities Wanting to Implement This:**

1. **Identify 20+ engaged residents** willing to participate in voting
2. **Find local technical volunteer** to help with smart contract deployment
3. **Secure initial $20-50 funding** (can be crowdfunded from community)
4. **Adapt governance rules** to local culture and needs
5. **Plan 3-month pilot** with 2-3 small projects
6. **Document everything** for transparency and future communities
