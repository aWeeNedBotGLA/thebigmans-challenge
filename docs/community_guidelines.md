**A practical guide for Scottish communities using theBigMan's $20 ETH Challenge solution**

## Getting Started

### 1. Join Your Local Community Fund

Each Scottish area (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Highlands, etc.) can deploy their own Community Impact Fund contract with initial seed funding.

**Requirements:**
- Proof of local connection (address, community involvement)
- Commitment to transparent reporting
- Agreement to community voting principles

### 2. Propose Impact Projects

**What Makes a Good Project:**
- ✅ Clear community benefit
- ✅ Measurable impact
- ✅ Realistic budget ($50-$500 range)
- ✅ Environmental consideration
- ✅ Open-source outcomes when possible

**Project Categories:**
- **Transport Solutions**: Bike sharing, public transport improvements
- **Energy Projects**: Community solar, energy efficiency programs  
- **Green Spaces**: Community gardens, tree planting, cleanup initiatives
- **Digital Tools**: Apps, websites, platforms that help the community
- **Education**: Skills training, workshops, community learning

### 3. Community Voting Process

**Voting Timeline:**
- **Week 1**: Project proposal and discussion
- **Week 2**: Community feedback and refinement
- **Week 3**: Formal voting period
- **Week 4**: Funding decision and next steps

**Voting Criteria:**
- **Impact**: How many people benefit?
- **Sustainability**: Will this create lasting value?
- **Feasibility**: Can it actually be delivered?
- **Innovation**: Does it try something new?
- **Community Support**: Do local people want this?

### 4. Project Implementation

**Once Funded:**
1. **Public Commitment**: Announce your project on community channels
2. **Regular Updates**: Weekly progress reports to voters
3. **Transparent Spending**: Public receipts and budget tracking
4. **Carbon Accounting**: Track and offset environmental impact
5. **Impact Measurement**: Document real outcomes for the community

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Glasgow Southside Bike Library
**Budget**: $300  
**CO2 Offset**: 180kg  
**Impact**: 50 families gained access to bikes, 2000 car journeys avoided  
**Outcome**: Model replicated in 3 other areas

### Example 2: Edinburgh Community App
**Budget**: $200  
**CO2 Offset**: 24kg  
**Impact**: Digital platform connecting 200+ neighbors for skill sharing  
**Outcome**: Open-sourced, now used by 8+ communities

### Example 3: Highland Community Solar
**Budget**: $500  
**CO2 Offset**: 400kg  
**Impact**: Renewable energy for community center, £200/year savings  
**Outcome**: Attracted £5000 additional investment from council

## Carbon Offset Integration

**Every project includes environmental impact:**

1. **Offset Calculation**: Automatic CO2 calculation based on project type
2. **Real Credit Purchase**: Verified carbon credits bought with 25% of budget
3. **Impact Reporting**: Clear metrics on environmental benefit
4. **Community Benefit**: Local projects + global climate action

**Carbon Budget Allocation:**
- 25% of total fund goes to verified carbon offsets
- Projects encouraged to choose lower-carbon options
- Bonus funding for projects with negative carbon impact

## Success Metrics

**Individual Project Success:**
- Delivered on time and budget
- Positive community feedback (80%+ satisfaction)
- Measurable impact achieved
- Carbon offset completed
- Documentation shared for replication

**Community Fund Success:**
- 4+ projects funded per funding cycle
- Growing community participation (new voters each round)
- Projects inspiring additional funding/support
- Model replicated in other areas
- Net positive environmental impact

## Governance Evolution

**Phase 1**: Admin-controlled membership (trusted community leaders)  
**Phase 2**: Community-nominated membership (existing members vote on new ones)  
**Phase 3**: Fully decentralized (token-based or reputation-based voting)

**Dispute Resolution:**
1. Community discussion (7 days)
2. Mediator involvement (trusted community member)
3. Formal arbitration (panel of 3 members)
4. Smart contract enforcement

## Scaling Up

## FAQ

**Q: What if my project fails or goes over budget?**
A: Community learns from failure too! Document what went wrong, what you learned, and how others can avoid the same issues. Honest failure is better than fake success.

**Q: Can the same person propose multiple projects?**
A: Yes, but community will consider your track record. Deliver well on your first project to build trust for future proposals.

**Q: What happens to unused funds?**
A: Rolls over to next funding cycle. Community can vote to reallocate between carbon offset, projects, and platform maintenance as needed.

**Q: How do we prevent abuse or fraud?**
A: Community voting, transparent spending, and real identity verification. Plus, amounts are small enough that the social cost of fraud isn't worth it.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: Project details are public for transparency. Personal information (addresses, phone numbers) kept private. Use pseudonyms if preferred.
